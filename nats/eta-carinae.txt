'''Eta Carinae''' (abbreviated to '''[[Eta|η]] Carinae''' or '''η Car'''), formerly known as '''Eta Argus''', is a [[star system|stellar system]] containing at least [[binary system|two stars]] with a combined [[luminosity]] greater than five million times that of the [[Sun]], located around 7,500&nbsp;[[light-year]]s (2,300&nbsp;[[parsec]]s) distant in the [[constellation]] [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]]. Previously a 4th-[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] star, it brightened in 1837 to become brighter than [[Rigel]] marking the start of the '''Great Eruption'''. Eta Carinae became the [[List of brightest stars|second-brightest star]] in the sky between 11 and 14 March 1843 before fading well below [[naked eye]] visibility after 1856. In a smaller eruption, it reached 6th magnitude in 1892 before fading again. It has brightened consistently since about 1940, becoming brighter than magnitude&nbsp;4.5 by 2014. Eta Carinae is [[circumpolar star|circumpolar]] south of [[30th parallel south|latitude 30°S]], so it is never visible north of about [[30th parallel north|latitude 30°N]].

The two main stars of the Eta Carinae system have an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric orbit]] with a [[orbital period|period]] of 5.54 years. The primary is a peculiar star similar to a [[luminous blue variable]] (LBV) that was initially {{solar mass|150–250|link=y}} of which it has lost at least {{solar mass|30}} already, and is expected to explode as a [[supernova]] in the astronomically near future. This is the only star known to produce [[ultraviolet]] [[laser]] emission. The secondary star is hot and also highly luminous, probably of [[O-type star|spectral class O]], around 30–80&nbsp;times as massive as the Sun. The system is heavily obscured by the [[Homunculus Nebula]], material ejected from the primary during the Great Eruption. It is a member of the [[Trumpler 16]] [[open cluster]] within the much larger [[Carina Nebula]]. Although unrelated to the star or nebula, the weak [[Eta Carinids]] [[meteor shower]] has a [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] very close to Eta Carinae.

==Observational history==
===Discovery and naming===
There is no reliable evidence of Eta Carinae being observed or recorded before the 17th century, although Dutch navigator [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser|Pieter Keyser]] described a fourth-magnitude star at approximately the correct position around 1595–96, which was copied onto the celestial globes of [[Petrus Plancius]] and [[Jodocus Hondius]] and the 1603 ''[[Uranometria]]'' of [[Johann Bayer]]. [[Frederick de Houtman]]'s independent star catalogue from 1603 does not include Eta Carinae among the other fourth-magnitude stars in the region. The earliest firm record was made by [[Edmond Halley]] in 1677 when he recorded the star simply as ''Sequens'' (i.e. "following" relative to another star) within a new constellation [[Robur Carolinum]]. His ''Catalogus Stellarum Australium'' was published in 1679.<ref name="Halley 1679">{{cite book|last=Halley|first=Edmund|title=Catalogus stellarum australium; sive, Supplementum catalogi Tychenici, exhibens longitudines et latitudines stellarum fixarum, quae, prope polum Antarcticum sitae, in horizonte Uraniburgico Tychoni inconspicuae fuere, accurato calculo ex distantiis supputatas, & ad annum 1677 completum correctas&nbsp;...

Eta Carinae is too far south to be part of the [[Twenty-Eight Mansions|mansion-based]] [[Chinese astronomy|traditional Chinese astronomy]], but it was mapped when the [[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms (近南極星區)|Southern Asterisms]] were created at the start of the 17th century.

Halley gave an approximate [[apparent magnitude]] of "4" at the time of discovery, which has been calculated as magnitude 3.3 on the modern scale. The handful of possible earlier sightings suggest that Eta Carinae was not significantly brighter than this for much of the 17th century.<ref name=frew/> Further sporadic observations over the next 70&nbsp;years show that Eta Carinae was probably around 3rd&nbsp;magnitude or fainter, until Lacaille reliably recorded it at 2nd magnitude in 1751.<ref name=frew/> It is unclear whether Eta Carinae varied significantly in brightness over the next 50&nbsp;years; there are occasional observations such as [[William Burchell]]'s at 4th magnitude in 1815, but it is uncertain whether these are just re-recordings of earlier observations.<ref name=frew/>

===Great Eruption===
In 1827 Burchell specifically noted Eta Carinae's unusual brightness at 1st&nbsp;magnitude, and was the first to suspect that it varied in brightness.<ref name=frew/> [[John Herschel]] made a detailed series of accurate measurements in the 1830s showing that Eta Carinae consistently shone around magnitude&nbsp;1.4 until November 1837. On the evening of December 16, 1837, Herschel was astonished to see that it had brightened to slightly outshine [[Rigel]].<ref name=herschel/> This event marked the beginning of a roughly 18-year period known as the Great Eruption.<ref name=frew/>

Eta Carinae was brighter still on January 2, 1838, equivalent to [[Alpha Centauri]], before fading slightly over the following three months. Herschel did not observe the star after this, but received correspondence from the Reverend W.S. Mackay in Calcutta, who wrote in 1843, "To my great surprise I observed this March last (1843), that the star Eta Argus had become a star of the first magnitude fully as bright as [[Canopus]], and in colour and size very like [[Arcturus]]." Observations at the Cape of Good Hope indicated it peaked in brightness, surpassing Canopus, over March 11 to 14, 1843 before beginning to fade, then brightened to between the brightness of Alpha Centauri and Canopus between March 24 and 28 before fading once again.<ref name=herschel>{{cite book| author=Herschel, John Frederick William |title= Results of astronomical observations made during the years 1834, 5, 6, 7, 8, at the Cape of Good Hope: being the completion of a telescopic survey of the whole surface of the visible heavens, commenced in 1825 | volume= 1 |publisher= Smith, Elder and Co. |location=London, United Kingdom |pages=33–35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WBNAAAAcAAJ&q=Eta+Carinae#v=onepage&q=Canopus&f=false |year=1847}}</ref> For much of 1844 the brightness was midway between Alpha Centauri and [[Beta Centauri]], around magnitude +0.2, before brightening again at the end of the year.

===Lesser Eruption===
A new brightening started in 1887, peaked at about magnitude&nbsp;6.2 in 1892, then at the end of March 1895 faded rapidly to about magnitude&nbsp;7.5.<ref name=frew/> Although there are only visual records of the 1890 eruption, it has been calculated that Eta Carinae was suffering 4.3 magnitudes of visual extinction due to the gas and dust ejected in the Great Eruption.

===Twentieth century===
Between 1900 and at least 1940, Eta Carinae appeared to have settled at a constant brightness at around magnitude&nbsp;7.6,<ref name=frew/> but in 1953 it was noted to have brightened again to magnitude&nbsp;6.5.<ref name=thackeray>{{cite journal|bibcode=1953MNRAS.113..237T|title=Stars, Variable: Note on the brightening of Eta Carinae|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=113|issue=2|pages=237|author1=Thackeray|first1=A.

===Visual spectrum===

The [[Equivalent width|strength]] and [[spectral line shape|profile]] of the [[spectral line|line]]s in the Eta Carinae [[spectrum]] are highly variable, but there are a number of consistent distinctive features. The spectrum is dominated by [[emission line]]s, usually broad although the higher excitation lines are overlaid by a narrow central component from dense [[ionisation|ionised]] nebulosity, especially the [[Weigelt Blobs]]. Most lines show a [[P Cygni#P Cygni Profile|P Cygni profile]] but with the absorption wing much weaker than the emission. The broad P Cygni lines are typical of strong [[stellar wind]]s, with very weak [[absorption spectrum|absorption]] in this case because the central star is so heavily obscured. [[Thomson scattering|Electron scattering wings]] are present but relatively weak, indicating a clumpy wind. [[Hydrogen spectral series|Hydrogen lines]] are present and strong, showing that Eta Carinae still retains much of its [[hydrogen]] envelope. [[Ion notation|He<sub>I</sub>]]<ref group="n">The roman numerals are [[ion notation]], where "I" indicates neutral elements, "II" singly ionized elements, etc."</ref> lines are much weaker than the hydrogen lines, and the absence of He<sub>II</sub> lines provides an upper limit to the possible temperature of the primary star. N<sub>II</sub> lines can be identified but are not strong, while carbon lines cannot be detected and oxygen lines are at best very weak, indicating [[Stellar evolution#Hydrogen fusion|core hydrogen burning]] via the [[CNO cycle]] with some mixing to the surface. Perhaps the most striking feature is the rich Fe<sub>II</sub> emission in both [[forbidden mechanism|permitted and forbidden lines]], with the forbidden lines arising from excitation of low density nebulosity around the star.<ref name=hillier/><ref>{{cite journal|bibcode=1992A&A...262..153H|title=A spectroscopic investigation of Eta Carinae and the Homunculus Nebula.

The earliest analyses of the star's spectrum are descriptions of visual observations from 1869, of prominent emission lines "C, D, b, F, and the principal green nitrogen line".

Photographic spectra from 1893 were described as similar to an F5 star, but with a few weak emission lines. Analysis to modern spectral standards suggests an early F [[Stellar classification|spectral type]]. By 1895 the spectrum again consisted mostly of strong emission lines, with the absorption lines present but largely obscured by emission. This spectral transition from F [[supergiant]] to strong emission is characteristic of [[nova]]e, where ejected material initially radiates like a pseudo-[[photosphere]] and then the emission spectrum develops as it expands and thins.<ref name=walborn/>

The emission line spectrum associated with dense stellar winds has persisted ever since the late 19th century. Individual lines show widely varying [[Spectral line#Line broadening and shift|widths, profiles, and Doppler shifts]], often multiple velocity components within the same line. The spectral lines also show variation over time, most strongly with a 5.5-year period but also less dramatic changes over shorter and longer periods, as well as ongoing secular development of the entire spectrum.<ref name=baxendall>{{cite journal|bibcode=1919MNRAS..79..619B|title=Note on apparent changes in the spectrum of η Carinæ|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=79|issue=9 |pages=619|author1=Baxandall|first1=F.

Direct spectral observations did not begin until after the Great Eruption, but [[light echo]]es from the eruption reflected from other parts of the Carina Nebula were detected using the [[National Optical Astronomy Observatory|U.S. National Optical Astronomy Observatory's]] [[Víctor M.

In the second half of the 20th century, much higher resolution visual spectra became available. The spectrum continued to show complex and baffling features, with much of the energy from the central star being recycled into the infrared by surrounding dust, some reflection of light from the star from dense localised objects in the circumstellar material, but with obvious high ionisation features indicative of very high temperatures. The line profiles are complex and variable, indicating a number of absorption and emission features at various [[Doppler effect|velocities relative]] to the central star.<ref name=davidson1986>{{cite journal|bibcode=1986ApJ...305..867D|title=Ultraviolet and visual wavelength spectroscopy of gas around ETA Carinae|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=305|pages=867|author1=Davidson|first1=K.|last2=Dufour|first2=R.

The 5.5&nbsp;year orbital cycle produces strong spectral changes at periastron that are known as ''spectroscopic events''. Certain wavelengths of radiation suffer eclipses, either due to actual [[occultation]] by one of the stars or due to passage within opaque portions of the complex stellar winds. Despite being ascribed to orbital rotation, these events vary significantly from cycle to cycle. These changes have become stronger since 2003 and it is generally believed that long-term secular changes in the stellar winds or previously ejected material may be the culmination of a return to the state of the star before its Great Eruption.<ref name=landes>{{cite journal|bibcode=2010PASA...27..374L |title=Photometric Observations of the η Carinae 2009.0 Spectroscopic Event|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|volume=27|issue=3|pages=374–377 |author1=Landes|first1=H.|last2=Fitzgerald|first2=M.|year=2010|doi=10.1071/AS09036|arxiv = 0912.2557}}</ref><ref name=martin2014>{{cite journal|bibcode=2014AAS...22315109M |title=Eta Carinae's change of state: First new HST/NUV data since 2010, and the first new FUV since 2004|journal=American Astronomical Society|volume=223|pages=#151.09 |author1=Martin|first1=John C.|last2=Mehner|first2=A.|last3=Ishibashi|first3=K.|last4=Davidson|first4=K.|last5=Humphreys|first5=R.

===Ultraviolet===
The [[ultraviolet]] spectrum of the Eta Carinae system shows many emission lines of ionised metals such as Fe<sub>II</sub> and Cr<sub>II</sub>, as well as [[Lyman series|Lyman]]<sub>α</sub> (Ly<sub>α</sub>) and a continuum from a hot central source. The ionisation levels and continuum require the existence of a source with a temperature at least 37,000&nbsp;K.<ref name=uv>{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/509785|title=Eta Carinae across the 2003.5 Minimum: Deciphering the Spectrum toward Weigelt D|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series|volume=168|issue=2|pages=289|year=2007|last1=Nielsen|first1=K.

Certain Fe<sub>II</sub> UV lines are unusually strong. These originate in the Weigelt Blobs and are caused by a [[gain (laser)|low-gain]] [[Laser|lasing]] effect. Ionised hydrogen between a blob and the central star generates intense Ly<sub>α</sub> emission which penetrates the blob. The blob contains [[Hydrogen atom|atomic hydrogen]] with a small admixture of other elements, including iron [[photo-ionisation|photo-ionised]] by radiation from the central stars. An accidental [[Resonance#Optical resonance|resonance]] (where emission coincidentally has a suitable energy to [[optical pumping|pump]] the excited state) allows the Ly<sub>α</sub> emission to pump the Fe<sup>+</sup> [[ion]]s to certain [[metastability|pseudo-metastable states]],<ref>{{cite book |isbn=978-0-19-156335-5 |title=Astrophysical Lasers |author1=Vladilen Letokhov |author2=Sveneric Johansson|publisher=OUP Oxford |page=39|year=June 2008}}</ref> creating a [[population inversion]] that allows the [[stimulated emission]] to take place.<ref name=johansson77>{{cite journal|bibcode=1999ASPC..179..171J|title=Atomic Physics Aspects on Previously and Newly Identified Iron Lines in the HST Spectrum of η Carinae|journal=Eta Carinae at the Millennium|volume=179|pages=171|author1=Johansson|first1=S.|last2=Zethson|first2=T.|year=1999}}</ref> This effect is similar to the [[astrophysical maser|maser]] emission from dense pockets surrounding many cool supergiant stars, but the latter effect is much weaker at optical and UV wavelengths and Eta Carinae is the only clear instance detected of an ultraviolet [[astrophysical laser]].

[[File:Stars similar to Eta Carinae in nearby galaxies.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Array of images of ten stars similar to Eta Carinae in nearby galaxies|Stars similar to Eta Carinae in nearby galaxies]]
Infrared observations of Eta Carinae have become increasingly important. The vast majority of the electromagnetic radiation from the central stars is absorbed by surrounding dust, then emitted as [[mid-infrared|mid-]] and [[far infrared]] appropriate to the temperature of the dust. This allows almost the entire energy output of the system to be observed at wavelengths that are not strongly affected by [[Extinction (astronomy)|interstellar extinction]], leading to estimates of the luminosity that are more accurate than for other [[List of most luminous known stars|extremely luminous star]]s. Eta Carinae is the brightest source in the night sky at mid-infrared wavelengths.<ref name=mehner2014>{{cite journal|bibcode=2014A&A...564A..14M|title=Near-infrared evidence for a sudden temperature increase in Eta Carinae|journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics|volume=564|pages=A14 |author1=Mehner|first1=Andrea|last2=Ishibashi|first2=Kazunori|last3=Whitelock|first3=Patricia|last4=Nagayama|first4=Takahiro|last5=Feast|first5=Michael|last6=van Wyk |first6=Francois|last7=de Wit|first7=Willem-Jan|year=2014|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201322729|arxiv = 1401.4999}}</ref>

Far infrared observations show a large mass of dust at 100–150 K, suggesting a total mass for the Homunculus of 20 [[solar mass]]es ({{solar mass}}) or more. This is much larger than previous estimates, and is all thought to have been ejected in a few years during the Great Eruption.<ref name=impostors/>

[[Near-infrared]] observations can penetrate the dust at high resolution to observe features that are completely obscured at visual wavelengths, although not the central stars themselves. The central region of the Homunculus contains a smaller ''Little Homunculus'' from the 1890 eruption, a ''butterfly'' of separate clumps and filaments from the two eruptions, and an elongated stellar wind region.<ref name=artigau>{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/141/6/202|title=Penetrating the Homunculus—Near-Infrared Adaptive Optics Images of Eta Carinae|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=141|issue=6|pages=202|year=2011|last1=Artigau|first1=Étienne|last2=Martin|first2=John C. |last3=Humphreys|first3=Roberta M.|last4=Davidson|first4=Kris|last5=Chesneau|first5=Olivier|last6=Smith|first6=Nathan|bibcode=2011AJ....141..202A|arxiv = 1103.4671 }}</ref>

===Radio emission===
[[radio astronomy|Radio]] emissions have been observed from Eta Carinae across the [[microwave]] band. It has been detected in the [[hydrogen line|21 cm]] H<sub>I</sub> line, but has been particularly closely studied in the [[millimetre wave|millimetre]] and [[Super high frequency|centimetre band]]s. [[Maser|Masing]] hydrogen [[recombination line]]s (from the combining of an electron and proton to form a hydrogen atom) have been detected in this range. The emission is concentrated in a small non-point source less than 4 [[arcsecond]]s across and appears to be mainly free-free emission (thermal [[bremsstrahlung]]) from ionised gas, consistent with a compact H<sub>II</sub> region at around 10,000&nbsp;K.<ref name=radio>{{cite journal|bibcode=2005A&A...437..977A|title=Millimeter-wave emission during the 2003 low excitation phase of η Carinae|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=437|issue=3|pages=977|author1=Abraham|first1=Z.|last2=Falceta-Gonçalves|first2=D.|last3=Dominici|first3=T.

The radio emission from Eta Carinae shows continuous variation in strength and distribution over a 5.5 year cycle. The H<sub>II</sub> and recombination lines vary very strongly, with continuum emission (electromagnetic radiation across a broad band of wavelengths) less affected. This shows a dramatic reduction in the ionisation level of the hydrogen for a short period in each cycle, coinciding with the spectroscopic events at other wavelengths.<ref name=KashiSoker2007>{{cite journal|bibcode=2007astro.ph..2389K|title=Modelling the Radio Light Curve of Eta Carinae|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=378|issue=4|pages=1609–18|author1=Kashi|first1=Amit|last2=Soker|first2=Noam |year=2007|arxiv=astro-ph/0702389|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.11908.x}}</ref><ref name=white>{{cite conference|bibcode=2005ASPC..332..126W|title=The Radio Cycle of Eta Carinae |journal=The Fate of the Most Massive Stars|volume=332|pages=126|author1=White|first1=S.

Eta Carinae is found within the Carina Nebula, a giant [[star-forming region]] in the [[Carina–Sagittarius Arm]] of the [[Milky Way]].

The lobes of the Homunculus are considered to be formed almost entirely due to the initial eruption, rather than shaped by or including previously ejected or interstellar material, although the scarcity of material near the equatorial plane allows some later stellar wind and ejected material to mix. Therefore, the mass of the lobes gives an accurate measure of the scale of the Great Eruption, with estimates ranging from {{solar mass|12–15}} up to as high as {{solar mass|40}}.<ref name=impostors/><ref name=gomez>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1745-3933.2009.00784.x|title=Submillimetre variability of Eta Carinae: Cool dust within the outer ejecta|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters|volume=401|pages=L48|year=2010|last1=Gomez|first1=H.

A unique feature of the Homunculus is the ability to measure the spectrum of the central object at different latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes. These clearly show a ''polar wind'' where the stellar wind is faster and stronger at high latitudes thought to be due to rapid rotation causing [[gravity darkening|gravity brightening]] towards the poles. In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane.<ref name=latitude>{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/367641|title=Latitude‐dependent Effects in the Stellar Wind of η Carinae|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=586|pages=432|year=2003 |last1=Smith|first1=Nathan|last2=Davidson|first2=Kris|last3=Gull|first3=Theodore R.|last4=Ishibashi|first4=Kazunori|last5=Hillier|first5=D.

==Distance==
The distance to Eta Carinae has been determined by several different methods, resulting in a widely accepted value of 2,300&nbsp;parsecs (7,800&nbsp;light-years), with a margin of error around 100&nbsp;parsecs (330&nbsp;light-years).<ref name=company/> Eta Carinae's distance cannot be measured using [[Stellar parallax|parallax]] due to its great distance from Earth and the surrounding nebulosity. At least two stars expected to be at a similar distance are in the [[Hipparcos]] catalog. These are [[HD 93250]] in [[Trumpler 16]] and [[HD 93403]], another member of Trumpler 16 or possibly of [[Trumpler 15]]. These two stars are assumed to be at approximately the same distance as Eta Carinae, all formed from the same molecular cloud, but the distances are too great for parallaxes to be reliable. HD 93250 and HD 93403 have recorded parallaxes of 0.53±0.42 milli-arcseconds (mas) and 1.22±0.45 mas respectively, suggesting distances of  anywhere from 2,000 to 30,000&nbsp;light-years (600 to 9,000&nbsp;parsecs).<ref name=hipparcos>{{cite journal|bibcode=2007A&A...474..653V|title=Validation of the new Hipparcos reduction|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=474|issue=2|pages=653|author1=van Leeuwen|first1=F.|year=2007|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20078357|arxiv = 0708.1752}}</ref> The [[Gaia (spacecraft)|GAIA]] space mission is expected to measure the parallax of these stars with excellent precision.

The distances to star clusters can be estimated by using a [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] or [[Color–color diagram|colour–colour diagram]] to calibrate the [[absolute magnitude]]s of the stars, for example fitting the [[main sequence]] or identifying features such as a [[horizontal branch]], and hence their distance from Earth. It is also necessary to know the amount of interstellar extinction to the cluster and this can be difficult in regions such as the Carina Nebula.<ref name=the>{{cite journal |bibcode=1980A&AS...41...93T|title=Studies of the Carina Nebula.

The known expansion rate of the Homunculus Nebula provides an unusual geometric method for measuring its distance. Assuming that the two lobes of the nebula are symmetrical, the projection of the nebula onto the sky depends on its distance.

The binary nature of Eta Carinae is clearly established, although the components have not been directly observed and cannot even be clearly resolved spectroscopically due to scattering and re-excitation in the surrounding nebulosity. Periodic photometric and spectroscopic variations prompted the search for a companion, and modelling of the colliding winds and partial "eclipses" of some spectroscopic features have constrained the possible orbits.<ref name=madura>{{cite journal|bibcode=2012MNRAS.420.2064M|title=Constraining the absolute orientation of η Carinae's binary orbit: A 3D dynamical model for the broad [Fe III] emission|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=420 |issue=3|pages=2064|author1=Madura|first1=T.

The period between the Great Eruption and the smaller 1890 eruption was apparently 5.52&nbsp;years, while before the Great Eruption it may have been lower still, possibly between 4.8 and 5.4&nbsp;years.<ref name="KashiSoker"/> The orbital separation is only known approximately, with a semi-major axis of 15–16&nbsp;AU. The orbit is highly eccentric, e = 0.9. This means that the separation of the stars varies from around 1.6&nbsp;AU, similar to the distance of Mars from the Sun, to 30&nbsp;AU, similar to the distance of Neptune.<ref name=madura/>

Perhaps the most valuable use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the masses of the stars. This requires the dimensions and inclination of the orbit to be accurately known. The dimensions of Eta Carinae's orbit are only known approximately as the stars cannot be directly and separately observed. The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but the orbit is still not known accurately enough to provide the masses of the two components.<ref name=madura/>

===Classification===
Eta Carinae A is classified as a [[luminous blue variable]] (LBV) due to the distinctive spectral and brightness variations. This type of [[variable star]] is characterised by irregular changes from a high temperature quiescent state to a low temperature outburst state at roughly constant luminosity. LBVs in the quiescent state lie on a narrow [[S Doradus]] instability strip, with more luminous stars being hotter. In outburst all LBVs have about the same temperature, which is near 8,000&nbsp;K. LBVs in a normal outburst are visually brighter than when quiescent although the [[wikt:bolometric magnitude|bolometric]] luminosity is unchanged.

A Great Eruption event similar to Eta Carinae A's has only been observed in one other star in the Milky Way—[[P Cygni]]—and in a handful of other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called [[supernova impostor]]s, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.<ref name=impostors>{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4614-2275-4| title = Eta Carinae and the Supernova Impostors| volume = 384| last1 = Davidson|first1 = Kris| last2 = Humphreys|first2 = Roberta M. | series = Astrophysics and Space Science Library| publisher = Springer Science & Business Media| location = New York, New York| year = 2012| isbn = 978-1-4614-2274-7|pages = 26–27}}</ref>

Eta Carinae A is not a typical LBV. It is more luminous than any other LBV in the Milky Way although possibly comparable to other supernova impostors detected in external galaxies. It does not currently lie on the S Doradus instability strip, although it is unclear what the temperature or spectral type of the underlying star actually is, and during its Great Eruption it was much cooler than a typical LBV outburst. The 1890 eruption may have been fairly typical of LBV eruptions, with an early F spectral type, and it has been estimated that the star may currently have an opaque stellar wind forming a pseudo-photosphere with a temperature of 9,000 K–14,000 K which would be typical for an LBV in eruption.<ref name=davidson/>

Eta Carinae B is a massive luminous hot star, about which little else is known. From certain high excitation spectral lines that ought not to be produced by the primary, Eta Carinae B is thought to be a young [[O-type star]]. Most authors suggest it is a somewhat evolved star such as a supergiant or giant, although a [[Wolf–Rayet star]] cannot be ruled out.<ref name=massive/>

===Mass===
The masses of stars are difficult to measure except by determination of a binary orbit. Eta Carinae is a binary system, but certain key information about the orbit is not known accurately. The mass can be strongly constrained to be greater than {{solar mass|90}}, due to the high luminosity.<ref name=hillier/> Standard models of the system assume masses of {{solar mass|100–120}}<ref name=clementel/><ref name="KashiSoker"/> and {{solar mass|30–60}}<ref name="KashiSoker"/><ref name=mehner2015>{{cite journal|bibcode=2015A&A...578A.122M|arxiv=1504.04940|title=Eta Carinae's 2014.6 spectroscopic event: Clues to the long-term recovery from its Great Eruption |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics|volume=578|pages=A122|author1=Mehner|first1=A.|last2=Davidson|first2=K.|last3=Humphreys|first3=R.

===Mass loss===
[[File:ESO - The Carina Nebula (by).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|alt=Carina Nebula|The Carina Nebula. Eta Carinae is the brightest star, on the left side.]]
Mass loss is one of the most intensively studied aspects of massive star research. Put simply, using observed mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution does not reproduce the observed properties of evolved massive stars such as Wolf–Rayets, the number and types of [[Supernova#Core collapse|core collapse supernovae]], or their progenitors. To match those observations, the models require much higher mass loss rates. Eta Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates, currently around {{solar mass|10<sup>−3</sup>}}/year, and is an obvious candidate for study.<ref name="kashi">{{Cite journal | last1 = Kashi | first1 = A. | last2 = Soker | first2 = N. | doi =10.1016/j.newast.2008.04.003 | title = Possible implications of mass accretion in Eta Carinae | journal = New Astronomy | volume = 14 | pages = 11 | year = 2009 |arxiv = 0802.0167 |bibcode = 2009NewA...14...11K }}</ref>

Eta Carinae A is losing so much mass due to its extreme luminosity and relatively low surface gravity. Its stellar wind is entirely opaque and appears as a pseudo-photosphere; this optically dense surface hides the true physical surface of the star. During the Great Eruption the mass loss rate was a thousand times higher, around {{solar mass|1}}/year sustained for ten years or more. The total mass loss during the eruption was at least {{solar mass|10–20}} with much of it now forming the Homunculus Nebula. The smaller 1890 eruption produced the ''Little Homunculus Nebula'', much smaller and only about {{solar mass|0.1}}.<ref name=gull/> The bulk of the mass loss occurs in a wind with a terminal velocity of about 420&nbsp;km/s, but some material is seen at higher velocities, up to 3,200&nbsp;km/s, possibly material blown from the accretion disk by the secondary star.<ref name=noam>{{cite journal|bibcode=2004ApJ...612.1060S|title=Why a Single-Star Model Cannot Explain the Bipolar Nebula of η Carinae|journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=612|issue=2|pages=1060|author1=Soker|first1=Noam|year=2004|doi=10.1086/422599|arxiv = astro-ph/0403674}}</ref>

Eta Carinae B is presumably also losing mass via a thin fast stellar wind, but this cannot be detected directly. Models of the radiation observed from interactions between the winds of the two stars show a mass loss rate of the order of {{solar mass|10<sup>−5</sup>}}/year at speeds of 3,000&nbsp;km/s, typical of a hot O class star.<ref name=pittard/>  For a portion of the highly [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] orbit, it may actually gain material from the primary via an [[accretion disk]]. During the Great Eruption of the primary, the secondary could have accreted {{solar mass|several}}, producing strong jets which formed the bipolar shape of the Homunculus Nebula.<ref name=kashi/>

===Luminosity===
The stars of the Eta Carinae system are completely obscured by dust and opaque stellar winds, with much of the ultraviolet and visual radiation shifted to infrared. The total electromagnetic radiation across all wavelengths for both stars combined is several million solar luminosities ({{solar luminosity}}).<ref name=groh>{{cite journal |bibcode=2012MNRAS.423.1623G|title=On the influence of the companion star in Eta Carinae: 2D radiative transfer modelling of the ultraviolet and optical spectra|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=423|issue=2|pages=1623|author1=Groh|first1=Jose H.|last2=Hillier|first2=D.

The luminosity of Eta Carinae B is particularly uncertain, probably {{solar luminosity|several hundred thousand}} and almost certainly no more than {{solar luminosity|1 million}}.

The most notable feature of Eta Carinae is its giant eruption or supernova impostor event, which originated in the primary star and was observed around 1843. In a few years, it produced almost as much visible light as a faint supernova explosion, but the star survived. It is estimated that at peak brightness the luminosity was as high as {{solar luminosity|50 million}}.<ref name=impostors/> Other supernova impostors have been seen in other galaxies, for example the possible false supernova [[SN 1961v]] in [[NGC 1058]]<ref name="Stockdale_2001">{{cite journal | doi= 10.1086/321136 | last1 = Stockdale | first1 = Christopher J. | last2 = Rupen | first2 = Michael P. | last3 = Cowan | first3 = John J. | last4 = Chu | first4 = You-Hua | last5 = Jones | first5 = Steven S. | date = 2001 | title = The fading radio emission from SN 1961v: evidence for a Type II peculiar supernova? | journal = The Astronomical Journal | volume = 122 | issue = 1| page = 283 | bibcode = 2001AJ....122..283S | arxiv = astro-ph/0104235}}</ref> and [[SN 2006jc]] in [[UGC 4904]].<ref name=pastorello>{{cite journal|bibcode= 2007Natur.447..829P|doi=10.1038/nature05825|pmid=17568740|title=A giant outburst two years before the core-collapse of a massive star|journal=Nature|volume=447|issue=7146|pages=829|year=2007|last1=Pastorello|first1=A.|last2=Smartt|first2=S.

Following the Great Eruption, Eta Carinae became self-obscured by the ejected material, resulting in dramatic reddening. This has been estimated at four magnitudes at visual wavelengths, meaning the post-eruption luminosity was comparable to the luminosity when first identified.<ref>{{cite journal|bibcode=2011MNRAS.415..773S|title=Luminous blue variable eruptions and related transients: Diversity of progenitors and outburst properties|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=415|pages=773 |author1=Smith|first1=Nathan|last2=Li|first2=Weidong|last3=Silverman|first3=Jeffrey M.|last4=Ganeshalingam|first4=Mohan|last5=Filippenko|first5=Alexei V.|year=2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18763.x|arxiv = 1010.3718 }}</ref> Eta Carinae is still much brighter at infrared wavelengths, despite the presumed hot stars behind the nebulosity. The recent visual brightening is considered to be largely caused by a decrease in the extinction, due to thinning dust or a reduction in mass loss, rather than an underlying change in the luminosity.<ref name=mehner2012/>

===Temperature===
[[File:Eta Car, Hubble-ESO.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=The Homunculus Nebula on the left, and a zoomed-in infrared image on the right|HST image of the Homunculus Nebula; inset is a [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] NACO infrared image of Eta Carinae.]]
Until late in the 20th century, the temperature of Eta Carinae was assumed to be over 30,000&nbsp;K because of the presence of high excitation spectral lines, but other aspects of the spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models were created to account for this.<ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1093/mnras/154.4.415|title= On the Nature of Eta Carinae|journal= Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume= 154|issue= 4|pages= 415|year= 1971|last1= Davidson|first1= K.|bibcode= 1971MNRAS.154..415D}}</ref> It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists of at least two stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, embedded within a dusty nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the mid and far infrared. All of these features have different temperatures.

The powerful stellar winds from the two stars collide in a roughly conical WWC zone and produce temperatures as high as {{val|100|ul=MK}} at the apex between the two stars. This zone is the source of the hard x-rays and gamma-rays close to the stars. Near periastron, as the secondary ploughs through ever denser regions of the primary wind, the colliding wind zone becomes distorted into a spiral trailing behind Eta Carinae B.<ref name=3d>{{cite journal|bibcode=2013MNRAS.436.3820M |title=Constraints on decreases in η Carinae's mass-loss from 3D hydrodynamic simulations of its binary colliding winds |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=436 |issue=4 |pages=3820 |author1=Madura |first1=T.

The wind-wind collision cone separates the winds of the two stars. For 55–75° behind the secondary, there is a thin hot wind typical of O or Wolf–Rayet stars. This allows some radiation from Eta Carinae B to be detected and its temperature can be estimated with some accuracy due to spectral lines that are unlikely to be produced by any other source. Although the secondary star has never been directly observed, there is widespread agreement on models where it has a temperature between 37,000&nbsp;K and 41,000&nbsp;K.<ref name=mehner/>

In all other directions on the other side of the wind-wind collision zone, there is the wind from Eta Carinae A, cooler and around 100 times denser than Eta Carinae B's wind. It is also optically dense, completely obscuring anything resembling a true photosphere and rendering any definition of its temperature moot. The observable radiation originates from a pseudo-photosphere where the [[optical density]] of the wind drops to near zero, typically measured at a particular [[Opacity (optics)|Rossland opacity]] value such as {{frac|2|3}}. This pseudo-photosphere is observed to be elongated and hotter along the presumed axis of rotation.<ref name=boekel>{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20031500|title=Direct measurement of the size and shape of the present-day stellar wind of η Carinae|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=410|issue=3|pages=L37 |year=2003|last1=van Boekel|first1=R.|last2=Kervella|first2=P.|last3=SchöLler|first3=M.|last4=Herbst|first4=T.|last5=Brandner|first5=W.|last6=de Koter|first6=A. |last7=Waters|first7=L.

Eta Carinae A is likely to have appeared as an early B [[hypergiant]] with a temperature of between 20,000&nbsp;K and 25,000&nbsp;K at the time of its discovery by Halley. An [[effective temperature]] determined for the surface of a spherical optically thick wind at {{solar radius|several hundred}} would be 9,400–15,000&nbsp;K, while the temperature of a theoretical {{solar radius|60}} hydrostatic "core" at [[Optical depth (astrophysics)|optical depth]] 150 would be 35,200&nbsp;K.<ref name=martin2014/><ref name=mehner2012/><ref name=groh/><ref name=martin>{{cite journal|bibcode=2010AJ....139.2056M|title=Mid-cycle Changes in Eta Carinae|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=139 |issue=5|pages=2056|author1=Martin|first1=John C.|last2=Davidson|first2=Kris|last3=Humphreys|first3=Roberta M.|last4=Mehner|first4=Andrea|year=2010 |doi=10.1088/0004-6256/139/5/2056|arxiv = 0908.1627 }}</ref> The effective temperature of the visible outer edge of the opaque primary wind is generally treated as being 15,000&nbsp;K–25,000&nbsp;K on the basis of visual and ultraviolet spectral features assumed to be directly from the wind or reflected via the Weigelt Blobs.<ref name=impostors/><ref name=gull/>

===Size===
[[File:EtaCarinae.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|alt=Eta Carinae|[[Hubble Space Telescope]] image showing the bipolar [[Homunculus Nebula]] which surrounds Eta Carinae]]
The size of the two main stars in the Eta Carinae system is difficult to determine precisely because neither star can be seen directly. Eta Carinae B is likely to have a well-defined photosphere and its radius can be estimated from the assumed type of star. An O supergiant of {{solar luminosity|933,000}} with a temperature of 37,200&nbsp;K has an effective radius of {{solar radius|23.6}}.<ref name=verner/>

The size of Eta Carinae A is not even well defined. It has an optically dense stellar wind so the typical definition of a star's surface being approximately where it becomes opaque gives a very different result to where a more traditional definition of a surface might be. One study calculated a radius of {{solar radius|60}} for a hot "core" of 35,000&nbsp;K at [[optical depth]] 150, near the sonic point or very approximately what might be called a physical surface. At optical depth 0.67 the radius would be {{solar radius|over 800}}, indicating an extended optically thick stellar wind.<ref name=hillier>{{cite journal |author=D. John Hillier |author2=K.

The stellar sizes should be compared with their orbital separation, which is only around {{solar radius|250}} at periastron. The accretion radius of the secondary is around {{solar radius|60}}, suggesting strong accretion near periastron leading to a collapse of the secondary wind.<ref name="KashiSoker"/> It has been proposed that the initial brightening from 4th magnitude to 1st at relatively constant bolometric luminosity was a normal LBV outburst, albeit from an extreme example of the class. Then the companion star passing through the expanded photosphere of the primary at periastron triggered the further brightening, increase in luminosity, and extreme mass loss of the Great Eruption.<ref name=smith2011/>

===Rotation===
Rotation rates of massive stars have a critical influence on their evolution and eventual death. The rotation rate of the Eta Carinae stars cannot be measured directly because their surfaces cannot be seen. Single massive stars spin down quickly due to braking from their strong winds, but there are hints that both Eta Carinae A and B are fast rotators, up to 90% of critical velocity. One or both could have been spun up by binary interaction, for example accretion onto the secondary and orbital dragging on the primary.<ref name=groh2010>{{cite journal|bibcode=2010ApJ...716L.223G|title=Is Eta Carinae a Fast Rotator, and How Much Does the Companion Influence the Inner Wind Structure?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|volume=716|issue=2|pages=L223|author1=Groh|first1=J.

==Evolution==

Eta Carinae is a unique object, with no very close analogues currently known in any galaxy. Therefore, its future evolution is highly uncertain, but almost certainly involves further mass loss and an eventual supernova.<ref name=khan>{{cite journal|bibcode=2015ApJ...799..187K|title=Finding η Car Analogs in Nearby Galaxies Using Spitzer.

Eta Carinae A would have begun life as an extremely hot star on the main sequence, already a highly luminous object over {{solar luminosity|a million}}. The exact properties would depend on the initial mass, which is expected to have been at least {{solar mass|150}} and possibly much higher. A typical spectrum when first formed would be O2If and the star would be mostly or fully [[stellar structure|convective]] due to CNO cycle fusion at the very high core temperatures. Sufficiently massive or [[Differential rotation|differentially rotating]] stars undergo such strong mixing that they remain chemically homogeneous during core hydrogen burning.<ref name=census>{{cite journal |bibcode=2006MNRAS.367..763S|title=A census of the Carina Nebula – I. Cumulative energy input from massive stars|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=367|issue=2|pages=763|author1=Smith|first1=Nathan|year=2006|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10007.x|arxiv = astro-ph/0601060}}</ref>

As core hydrogen burning progresses, a very massive star would slowly expand and become more luminous, becoming a blue hypergiant and eventually an LBV while still fusing hydrogen in the core. When hydrogen at the core is depleted after 2–2.5 million years, [[Stellar evolution#Mature stars|hydrogen shell burning]] continues with further increases in size and luminosity, although hydrogen shell burning in chemically homogeneous stars may be very brief or absent since the entire star would become depleted of hydrogen. In the late stages of hydrogen burning, mass loss is extremely high due to the high luminosity and enhanced surface abundances of helium and nitrogen. As hydrogen burning ends and [[Stellar evolution#Massive stars|core helium burning]] begins, massive stars transition very rapidly to the Wolf–Rayet stage with little or no hydrogen, increased temperatures, and decreased luminosity.  They are likely to have lost over half their initial mass at this point.<ref name=yusof>{{cite journal|bibcode=2013MNRAS.433.1114Y|title=Evolution and fate of very massive stars|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=433|issue=2|pages=1114|author1=Yusof|first1=Norhasliza|last2=Hirschi|first2=Raphael |last3=Meynet|first3=Georges|last4=Crowther|first4=Paul A.|last5=Ekström|first5=Sylvia|last6=Frischknecht|first6=Urs|last7=Georgy|first7=Cyril|last8=Abu Kassim|first8=Hasan |last9=Schnurr|first9=Olivier|year=2013|doi=10.1093/mnras/stt794|arxiv = 1305.2099}}</ref>

It is unclear whether [[triple-alpha process|triple-alpha]] helium fusion has started at the core of Eta Carinae A. The elemental abundances at the surface cannot be accurately measured, but ejecta within the Homunculus are around 60% hydrogen and 40% helium, with nitrogen enhanced to ten times solar levels. This is indicative of ongoing CNO cycle hydrogen fusion.<ref name=groh2014>{{cite journal|bibcode=2014A&A...564A..30G|title=The evolution of massive stars and their spectra. I.

Models of the evolution and death of single very massive stars predict an increase in temperature during helium core burning, with the outer layers of the star being lost.  It becomes a Wolf–Rayet star on the [[Wolf–Rayet star#Classification|nitrogen sequence]], moving from WNL to WNE as more of the outer layers are lost, possibly reaching the WC or WO spectral class as carbon and oxygen from the triple alpha process reach the surface. This process would continue with heavier elements being fused until an iron core develops, at which point the core collapses and the star is destroyed. Subtle differences in initial conditions, in the models themselves, and most especially in the rates of mass loss, produce different predictions for the final state of the most massive stars. They may survive to become a helium-stripped star or they may collapse at an earlier stage while they retain more of their outer layers.<ref name=groh2013>{{cite journal|bibcode=2013A&A...558A.131G|title=Fundamental properties of core-collapse supernova and GRB progenitors: Predicting the look of massive stars before death|journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics|volume=558|pages=A131|author1=Groh|first1=Jose H.|last2=Meynet|first2=Georges |last3=Georgy|first3=Cyril|last4=Ekström|first4=Sylvia|year=2013|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201321906|arxiv = 1308.4681}}</ref><ref name=meynet>{{cite journal |bibcode=2011BSRSL..80..266M|title=Red Supergiants, Luminous Blue Variables and Wolf–Rayet stars: The single massive star perspective|journal=Société Royale des Sciences de Liège|volume=80|pages=266|author1=Meynet|first1=Georges|last2=Georgy|first2=Cyril|last3=Hirschi|first3=Raphael|last4=Maeder|first4=André|last5=Massey|first5=Phil |last6=Przybilla|first6=Norbert|last7=Nieva|first7=M.-Fernanda|year=2011|arxiv = 1101.5873}}</ref><ref name=ekstrom>{{cite journal|bibcode=2012A&A...537A.146E|title=Grids of stellar models with rotation.

Eta Carinae is a close binary and this complicates the evolution of both stars. Compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars much more quickly than would occur in a single star, so the properties at core collapse can be very different. In some scenarios, the secondary can accrue significant mass, accelerating its evolution, and in turn be stripped by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary.<ref name=sana>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1223344|pmid=22837522|title=Binary Interaction Dominates the Evolution of Massive Stars|journal=Science|volume=337|issue=6093|pages=444|year=2012|last1=Sana|first1=H.|last2=de Mink|first2=S.

As a single star, a star originally around 150 times as massive as the Sun would typically reach core collapse as a Wolf–Rayet star within 3 million years.<ref name=groh2013/>  At low metallicity, many massive stars will collapse directly to a [[black hole]] with no visible explosion or a sub-luminous supernova, and a small fraction will produce a [[pair instability supernova]], but at solar metallicity and above there is expected to be sufficient mass loss before collapse to allow a visible supernova of [[Type Ib and Ic supernovae|type Ib or Ic]].<ref name=hegar>{{cite journal|bibcode=2003ApJ...591..288H|title=How Massive Single Stars End Their Life|journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=591|pages=288|author1=Heger|first1=A.|last2=Fryer|first2=C.

The existence of a massive companion brings many other possibilities. If Eta Carinae A was rapidly stripped of its outer layers, it might be a less massive WC- or WO-type star when core collapse was reached. This would result in a type Ib or type Ic supernova due to the lack of hydrogen and possibly helium. This supernova type is thought to be the originator of certain classes of gamma ray bursts, but models predict they occur only normally in less massive stars.<ref name=groh2013/><ref name=sana/><ref name=claeys>{{cite journal|bibcode=2011A&A...528A.131C|title=Binary progenitor models of type IIb supernovae|journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics|volume=528|pages=A131|author1=Claeys|first1=J.

Several unusual supernovae and impostors have been compared to Eta Carinae as examples of its possible fate. One of the most compelling is [[SN 2009ip]], a blue supergiant which underwent a supernova impostor event in 2009 with similarities to Eta Carinae's Great Eruption, then an even brighter outburst in 2012 which is likely to have been a true supernova.<ref name=2009ip>{{cite journal|bibcode=2014MNRAS.438.1191S|title=SN 2009ip and SN 2010mc: Core-collapse Type IIn supernovae arising from blue supergiants |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=438|issue=2|pages=1191|author1=Smith|first1=Nathan|last2=Mauerhan|first2=Jon C.|last3=Prieto|first3=Jose L. |year=2014|doi=10.1093/mnras/stt2269|arxiv = 1308.0112}}</ref> SN 2006jc, some 77 million light years away in UGC 4904, in the constellation [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]], also underwent a supernova impostor brightening in 2004, followed by a magnitude 13.8 type Ib supernova, first seen on 9 October 2006. Eta Carinae has also been compared to other possible supernova impostors such as [[SN 1961V]], and to superluminous supernovae such as [[SN 2006gy]].

===Possible effects on Earth===
[[File:Gamma ray burst.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|alt=Shells of progressive element burning, hydrogen, helium, carbon-oxygen-nitrogen, silicon, magnesium-neon and iron, followed by collapse with gamma ray burst jets developing from the poles|One theory of Eta Carinae's ultimate fate is collapsing to form a [[black hole]]—energy released as jets along the axis of rotation forms [[gamma-ray burst]]s.]]
A typical core collapse supernova at the distance of Eta Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to [[Venus]]. An SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently [[SN 1006]]). At 7,500 [[light-year]]s from the star it is unlikely to directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from [[gamma ray]]s by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the [[magnetosphere]]. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the [[ozone layer]], spacecraft, including [[satellite]]s, and any astronauts in space. At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth's ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a supernova, which would result in a significant increase in surface UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun. This would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than Eta Carinae.<ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1974Sci...184.1079R|title=Possible Consequences of Nearby Supernova Explosions for Atmospheric Ozone and Terrestrial Life|journal=Science|volume=184|issue=4141 |pages=1079–81|author1=Ruderman|first1=M.

It concludes that a supernova of this magnitude would have to be much closer than Eta Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.<ref name=thomas>{{cite journal|bibcode=2008AAS...212.0405T |title=Superluminous Supernovae: No Threat from Eta Carinae|journal=American Astronomical Society|volume=212|pages=193|author1=Thomas|first1=Brian|last2=Melott|first2=A.

Eta Carinae is not expected to produce a gamma-ray burst and its axis is not currently aimed near Earth, but a direct hit from a gamma-ray burst could cause catastrophic damage and a major extinction event. Calculations show that the deposited energy of such a gamma-ray burst striking the Earth's atmosphere would be equivalent to one [[kiloton]] of TNT per square kilometer over the entire hemisphere facing the star, with ionizing radiation depositing ten times the lethal whole body [[dosimetry|dose]] to the surface.<ref name="Dar De Rujula 2002">{{cite conference|author1=Arnon Dar|author2=A.
